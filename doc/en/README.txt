The Hear2Read Indic Voices is a free speech synthesizer for NVDA supporting Indic languages,  that generates natural human speech. It is based on the work done by the piper TTS team (https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) and takes some inspiration from the sonata-nvda addon (https://github.com/mush42/sonata-nvda).
